INTRODUCTION
------------

The original version of mlkid is here: https://github.com/jiangfeng1124/mlkid, I'm just the '跟屁虫' XD .

Seriously, I enjoy the moment of convergence and illustrating machine learning algorithm. However the codes here, they are not design to play on large-scale data, in another word, they are just some kind of toys.

But it's fun :D

COMPONENTS
----------

Following components has been implemented:

* ![Use EM algorithm to estimate parameters of Gaussian Mixture Model](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/gmm)
* ![Use K-Means algorithm to classify data drawn from two gaussian](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/k-means)
* ![Use KNN to estimate probability distribution and classify handwritten data](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/knn)
* ![Use parzen window to estimate probability distribution](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/parzen)
* ![A SVM classifier optimized with simplified SMO and its illustraction on 2-Dimension data](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/svm)
* ![A Logistic Regression classifier optimized with newton-raphson algorithm](https://github.com/Oneplus/anothermlkid/tree/master/logres)
