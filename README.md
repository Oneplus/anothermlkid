The original version of mlkid is here: https://github.com/jiangfeng1124/mlkid, I'm just the '跟屁虫' XD .

Seriously, I enjoy the moment of convergence and illustrating mechine learning algorithm. However the codes here, they are not design to play on large-scale data, in another word, they are just some kind of toys.
