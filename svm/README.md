#### DESCRIPTION

A Support Vector Machine optimazed with simplified SMO.

To demonstrate how it works, forty 2-D points are drawn from two gaussian distribution and a binary classification problem is created.

the points are shown below:

And the support vector I work out is like this:

The triangle point is support vector and the black line illustract the decission boundary.

What's more, no kernel function is applied in this demo.
